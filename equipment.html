<img src="assets/cocktail_shaker.jpg" alt="Shaker">
<p>On this page I will be supplying you with a few pieces of equipment that is necessary for a new bartender!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong><em>Bottle Opener-</em><br>
  </strong> This will be necessary because many bars will be serving bottled 
    beer. You cannot simply twist off the cap on many beers. For the bottles that do have twist off caps it could still be 
    advantageous to still use your bottle opener, considering twisting off caps throughout the day can be rough on your 
    hand <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong><em>&nbsp;Wine Tool-</em><br>
  </strong> While many bottles of wine have twist off caps you will still 
    surely run into plenty of corked bottles. I highly recommend the double lever corkscrew.<br>
    <li><strong><em>Cocktail Shaker-</em><br>
    </strong> A cocktail shaker will make it so that your drinks ingredients are evenly distributed. It is also 
    beneficial to add ice to your shaker so that the drink is poured cold.</li>
  <li>&nbsp;</li>
  <li><br>
      <strong><em>Strainer</em></strong><br>
      A strainer for your 
      cocktail shaker will also be necessary for when you are shaking with ice or fruit so that when you strain your drink it
      does not contain the unwanted items.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
  <strong><em>Pouring Spouts</em><br>
  </strong> Pouring spouts will be needed for your liquor 
bottles. These will make it easier for you to tell how much liquor you have poured into your drink by using counts. 
Each count is a quarter ounce of liquid, so a six count will be an ounce and a half of liquid.<br>
<strong><em>Muddler</em></strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong><br>
A muddler will be used to muddle fruit or herbs into your drink. For example, 
a mojito uses mint that you can muddle inside of your shaker to get more flavor out of the mint<strong>.&nbsp;<br>
</strong></li>
    <li><strong><em>Mixing Spoon</em></strong><br>
A mixing spoon can 
be used to mix drinks that are not supposed to be shaken. For example,      you are not 
supposed to shake gin or bourbon. A mixing spoon to mix the drink in the shaker will work well instead.<br>
<strong><em>Bar Mats</em><br>
</strong> Bar mats prevent unnecessary spillage which will 
help you avoid unnecessary cleaning throughout your shift, and you will be able to better focus on the job at hand. Bar mats will likely be supplied by your company.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
