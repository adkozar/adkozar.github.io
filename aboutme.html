<p class="fluidList">&nbsp;Hi Guys! My name is Andrew Kozar and I am the creator of New Bartender. I was born in Raleigh, North Carolina and have lived the Raleigh/ Wake Forest area for my whole life. I graduated from Wakefield High School in 2010 and attended Wake Tech Community College the year after.&nbsp; I took general studies classes and my goal was to get my Associates in Arts. I, however, did not know what I wanted to do for a living. Soon after I started working as a cook in the restaurant industry. I thought at the time that being a chef was what I wanted to do for a living. I worked my way up in the restaurant industry until I achieved the job of Sous Chef and Head Chef. Around this time I got engaged to my longtime girlfriend and we got married not long after in April, 2023.&nbsp; &nbsp; I decided that being a chef was not ideal for the life that I wanted with my wife. I enrolled back into Wake Tech and switched my course of study to business analytics. As far as work goes, I was lucky that a&nbsp; close friend of mine was able to get me a job as a event bartender for a local catering company. I am still fairly new to bartending but I am loving it so far. It is a nearly perfect job to work on the weekends while taking online classes. I created this website in hopes that others that are new to bartending will stumble across it and find useful information that will help them with being more comfortable with their new profession. I also hope that other bartenders that are not quite new to bartending are also able to learn a thing or two. Thank you for stopping by and I hope you enjoy my content!&nbsp;</p>
